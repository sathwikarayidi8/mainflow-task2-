<h1>ABOUT</h1>
<p>Hi there! I am Sathwika, the creator of Lavender Haazee. My story began when I was a kid wanting to make friendship bracelets and trade them with friends. A desire to create meaningful keepsakes.<br/>

I am passionate about creating beautiful and meaningful jewelry beyond just an accessory. Each piece is handcrafted with hands using traditional weaving methods and imbued with a touch of uniqueness. You can order and make customized jewelry for your loved ones or yourself.<br/>

We believe that jewelry can be a powerful symbol. Our collection features pieces designed based on current fashion trends with a touch of vintage designs. People of all age groups and genders can embrace our jewelry with joy.<br/></p>
